I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Yale University, where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Yang Cai](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/cai/).  I received my bachelor’s degree in EECS at Peking University, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm). My current research interest lies in the intersection between economics and computation, particularly on algorithmic game theory and Machine Learning.
