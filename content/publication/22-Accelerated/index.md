abstract: "We study monotone inclusions and monotone variational inequalities, as well as their generalizations to non-monotone settings. We first show that the Extra Anchored Gradient (EAG) algorithm, originally proposed by Yoon and Ryu [2021] for unconstrained convex-concave min-max optimization, can be applied to solve the more general problem of Lipschitz monotone inclusion. More specifically, we prove that the EAG solves Lipschitz monotone inclusion problems with an \emph{accelerated convergence rate} of O(1/T), which is optimal among all first-order methods [Diakonikolas, 2020, Yoon and Ryu, 2021]. Our second result is a new algorithm, called Extra Anchored Gradient Plus (EAG+), which not only achieves the accelerated O(1/T) convergence rate for all monotone inclusion problems, but also exhibits the same accelerated rate for a family of general (non-monotone) inclusion problems that concern negative comonotone operators. As a special case of our second result, EAG+ enjoys the O(1/T) convergence rate for solving a non-trivial class of nonconvex-nonconcave min-max optimization problems. Our analyses are based on simple potential function arguments, which might be useful for analysing other accelerated algorithms."
