  Understanding the convergence properties of learning dynamics in repeated
  auctions is a timely and important question in the area of learning in
  auctions, with numerous applications in, e.g., online advertising markets.
  This work focuses on repeated first price auctions where bidders with fixed
  values for the item learn to bid using mean-based algorithms -- a large class
  of online learning algorithms that include popular no-regret algorithms such
  as Multiplicative Weights Update and Follow the Perturbed Leader. We
  completely characterize the learning dynamics of mean-based algorithms, in
  terms of convergence to a Nash equilibrium of the auction, in two senses: (1)
  time-average: the fraction of rounds where bidders play a Nash equilibrium
  approaches 1 in the limit; (2) last-iterate: the mixed strategy profile of
  bidders approaches a Nash equilibrium in the limit. Specifically, the results
  depend on the number of bidders with the highest value: (1) If the number is at least three, the bidding dynamics almost surely converges to a Nash equilibrium of the auction, both in time-average and in last-iterate. (2) If the number is two, the bidding dynamics almost surely converges to a Nash equilibrium in time-average but not necessarily in last-iterate. (3) If the number is one, the bidding dynamics may not converge to a Nash equilibrium in time-average nor in last-iterate. Our discovery opens up new possibilities in the study of convergence dynamics of learning algorithms.
