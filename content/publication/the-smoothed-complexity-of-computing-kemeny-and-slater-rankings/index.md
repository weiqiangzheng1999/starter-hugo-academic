  The computational complexity of winner determination under common voting rules
  is a classical and fundamental topic in the field of computational social
  choice. Previous work has established the NP-hardness of winner determination
  under some commonly-studied voting rules, such as the Kemeny rule and the
  Slater rule. In a recent position paper, \citet{Baumeister2020:Towards}
  questioned the relevance of  the worst-case nature of NP-hardness in social
  choice and proposed to conduct smoothed complexity
  analysis~\cite{Spielman2009:Smoothed} under~\cites{Blaser2015:Smoothed}
  framework.


  In this paper, we develop the first smoothed complexity results for winner determination in voting.  We prove the smoothed hardness of Kemeny and Slater using the classical smoothed runtime analysis, and prove a parameterized typical-case smoothed easiness result for Kemeny. We also make an attempt of applying~\cites{Blaser2015:Smoothed}  smoothed complexity framework  in social choice contexts by proving that the framework categorizes an always-exponential-time brute force search algorithm as being smoothed poly-time, under a natural noise model based on the well-studied Mallows model in social choice and statistics. Overall, our results show that smoothed complexity analysis in computational social choice is a challenging and fruitful topic.
